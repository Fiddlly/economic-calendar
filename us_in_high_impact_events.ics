DESCRIPTION:Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is the primary measure of consumer spending on goods and services in the U.S. economy. 1 It accounts for about two-thirds of domestic final spending\, and thus it is the primary engine that drives future economic growth. PCE shows how much of the income earned by households is being spent on current consumption as opposed to how much is being saved for future consumption. PCE also provides a comprehensive measure of types of goods and services that are purchased by households. Thus\, for example\, it shows the portion of spending that is accounted for by discretionary items\, such as motor vehicles\, or the adjustments that consumers make to changes in prices\, such as a sharp run-up in gasoline prices.

DESCRIPTION:The Non-Manufacturing ISM Report On BusinessÂ® is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. Survey responses reflect the change\, if any\, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (Business Activity\, New Orders\, Backlog of Orders\, New Export Orders\, Inventory Change\, Inventory Sentiment\, Imports\, Prices\, Employment and Supplier Deliveries) this report shows the percentage reporting each response\, and the diffusion index. An index reading above 50 percent indicates that the non-manufacturing economy in that index is generally expanding\; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. Orders to the service producers make up about 90 percent of the US economy.
